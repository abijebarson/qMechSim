# SimpleQCSimulator
This is a "Why not?" project on a simple quantum computer simulator with some basic gates and so many ways to go wrong. 

This is totally ideal, meaning noiseless. So only intended for learning Quantum Computing basics. 
You won't even be needing this for learning. I mean... there are so many advanced and quantum simulators out there. Use them if you want to learn.
Use with caution. I do not do many error handling here.

Currently Used Gates: X Y Z H
